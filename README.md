# AdverseEvents
This was an analysis I performed and paper I wrote for Data Analytics III for the a master's in business analytics at UVA. The goal was to predict the probability of severe adverse reactions to medications.

Note: The data are owned by UVA and I don't believe I have the luxury of sharing them.
