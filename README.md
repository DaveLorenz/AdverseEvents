# AdverseEvents
I created this model and wrote this paper (pdf in repository) for Data Analytics III in the master's in business analytics program at UVA. The goal was to predict the probability of severe adverse reactions to medications using data on users, the medications users take, and text where users self report adverse reactions in an app (e.g., "I have been having bad stomach aches and back pains"). I utilized NLP and machine learning to predict the probability an event was severe.

Note: The data are owned by UVA and I don't believe I have the luxury of sharing them.
