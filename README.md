# AdverseEvents
I created this model and wrote this paper (pdf in repository) for Data Analytics III in the master's in business analytics program at UVA. The goal was to predict the probability of severe adverse reactions to medications. The data contain text where users self report adverse reactions in an app. The data also include information on the patients and drugs they are taking. I utilized NLP and machine learning to predict the probability an event was severe.

Note: The data are owned by UVA and I don't believe I have the luxury of sharing them.
