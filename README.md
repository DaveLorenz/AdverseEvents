# AdverseEvents
I created this model and wrote this paper (pdf in repository) for Data Analytics III in the master's in business analytics program at UVA. The goal was to predict the probability of severe adverse reactions to medications.

Note: The data are owned by UVA and I don't believe I have the luxury of sharing them.
